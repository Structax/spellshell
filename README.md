# SpellShell 🧙‍♂️

*A terminal where you cast spells instead of typing commands.*

---


## ✨ What is SpellShell?

SpellShell is a magical terminal interface where traditional shell commands are replaced with intuitive, fantasy-inspired spells.

No more `nginx -g daemon off`. Just say:

```bash
cast "summon nginx silently"
```

And watch the magic happen.

## 📚 SpellScript (v0.1 Draft)

A simple, readable scripting language designed for humans and wizards alike:

```spell
summon nginx silently
cloak api-key from output

while true:
  divine crash logs
```

SpellScript is a DSL (domain-specific language) designed to be expressive, whimsical, and just powerful enough to automate your dev life.
