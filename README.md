# SpellShell 🧙‍♂️

*A terminal where you cast spells instead of typing commands.*

> **What if the terminal felt like writing poetry?**  
> SpellShell turns commands into spells — expressive, readable, and powerful.  
> This is the beginning of a new era in human-computer interaction.

## ✨ What is SpellShell?

SpellShell is a magical terminal interface where traditional shell commands are replaced with intuitive, fantasy-inspired spells.

No more `nginx -g daemon off`. Just say:

```bash
cast "summon nginx silently"
```

And watch the magic happen.

## 🔮 Vision: A New Kind of Terminal

The command line is one of the most powerful interfaces ever created —  
but it hasn't evolved in decades.

SpellShell reimagines the terminal not as a tool, but as a **language for creation**,  
as expressive and readable as a story.

Our goal:  
- Replace cryptic syntax with intuitive spellcasting  
- Turn automation into art  
- Build a community where every developer can craft their own spells

This is not just a CLI.  
It's **an incantation layer for computing.**

## 📖 SpellScript (v0.1 Draft)

A simple, readable scripting language designed for humans and wizards alike:

```spell
summon nginx silently
cloak api-key from output

while true:
  divine crash logs
```

SpellScript is a DSL (domain-specific language) designed to be expressive, whimsical, and just powerful enough to automate your dev life.
