# ðŸ“œ SpellScript Grammar Specification (v0.1)

*SpellScript is a human-centric scripting language designed for spellcasting, automation, and narrative computing.*

---

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose

This document defines the formal grammar of **SpellScript**,  
a domain-specific language used in **SpellShell**, the magical command-line interface.

SpellScript aims to:
- Be readable and writable like natural language
- Map intuitive phrases to shell actions and plugins
- Serve as both scripting and spellcasting format

---

## ðŸ§  Basic Syntax

```spell
summon nginx silently
banish logs for 3 days
divine crash logs
```

Each spell is made up of:

```
<verb> <target> <modifier>?
```

### âœ… Examples:
- `summon nginx silently`
- `cloak api-key from output`
- `teleport repo to github`
- `divine crash logs`

## ðŸ“€ Grammar (PEG-like notation)

```peg
program         = _ spell+ _
spell           = command _ EOL
command         = verb _ target _ modifier*
verb            = "summon" / "banish" / "divine" / "cloak" / "teleport"
target          = WORD+
modifier        = WORD+

_               = (" " / "\t")*
EOL             = "\n" / "\r\n"
WORD            = [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+
```

ðŸ§™ Note: Future versions may support `while`, `if`, and block-based spells.
